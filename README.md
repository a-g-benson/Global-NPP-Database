Welcome to Andrew Benson's Global NPP Database.

I am making this data & code publicly available under the terms of Creative Commons license BY-NC-SA 4.0.

Currently, all data and code are available here: https://www.dropbox.com/s/kq011qlpp7jww1l/NPP%20Database.zip?dl=0

To run the Stata code for building the database, open ~\Do Files\Data Prep\main.do for editing and change the file directory in the first line. Then it should be ready to run.

To run the replication code, open ~\Do Files\Analysis\Econometrics.do for editing and change the file directory in the first line. Then it should be ready to run. I recommend you run the file in short segments and pay close attention to in-line comments to understand what analysis the code corresponds to.

Forthcoming:
- upload individual files to GitHub for easier browsing
- add additional documentation for Stata code
